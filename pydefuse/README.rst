-----------------
About *PyDeFuSE*
-----------------

*PyDeFuSE* is a python program that solves the orbital-free DFT equations (and maybe some day regular DFT)
using finite elements. It uses the finite element libraries FEniCS and DOLFIN. 

-------------------------------
Getting started with *PyDeFuSE*
-------------------------------

Download
========

Clone the github development repository::

  > git clone https://github.com/rartino/pydefuse

Installation
============

#. You need python with numpy

#. You need FEniCS and DOLFIN installed and working 
   (``from dolfin import *`` needs to work in python) 
     (see `<http://fenicsproject.org/download/>`_ or, in Debian/Ubuntu 
     ``apt-get install fenics python-mshr python-dolfin``)

#. For Ewald sum calculations with ionion='external' (which is the default) you need pymatgen. 
   Setting ionion='gaussians' should be good enough as long as your FE mesh is fine enough, 
   but this is much less tested. 
     (see `<http://pymatgen.org/#guided-install>`_ )

#. For mesh_type='jigzaw' you need the tetgen binary available in your path 
   (typing out 'tetgen' in your terminal needs to work). 
     (see `<http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/#Download>`_ or, in Debian/Ubuntu: ``apt-get install tetgen``)

#. After cloning the git repository you do not need to do anything more to run PyDeFuSE. Just run the examples.

User's guide
============

Try out the examples in the examples/ directory.

Known issues
************

* Code only really tested with periodic boundary conditions ``pbc=[True,True,True]``

* Radial part of code was working at some point but is not updated or tested since latest changes.

* Jigzaw mesh (``mesh_type='jigzaw'``) isn't well tested, and cannot handle muffin tins crossing the cell boundary. 
  Nor is there presently a way to configure the size of muffin tins.)

* Setting the number of electrons (``N=?``) to something other than None (meaning netural) is not tested. 
  It is meant to add a constant background to periodic calculations, and solve an ionic system for non-periodic BCs.
